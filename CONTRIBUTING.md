### Clean code features

Please consider contributing to one of the following clean code features by checking the box:

- [ ] **Feature: Refactor Component Structure**

  - **Description:** Review and refactor the component structure to follow a consistent pattern, such as container/presentation or atomic design. Consistent component structures improve code organization and maintainability.

- [ ] **Feature: Implement Design Patterns**

  - **Description:** Identify areas where design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Observer, Factory) can be applied to improve code structure and reusability. Design patterns help solve common design problems efficiently.

- [ ] **Feature: Code Cleanup**

  - **Description:** Conduct a thorough code cleanup to remove unused code, optimize imports, and ensure code consistency. A clean codebase is easier to read and maintain.

- [ ] **Feature: Performance Optimization**

  - **Description:** Profile and optimize performance bottlenecks in the code, such as database queries or rendering. Performance improvements lead to faster response times and a better user experience.

- [ ] **Feature: Documentation and Comments**

  - **Description:** Add missing documentation and comments to clarify code intent and usage. Well-documented code is more accessible to developers and helps with onboarding.

- [ ] **Feature: Testing Infrastructure**

  - **Description:** Enhance the testing infrastructure to include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for critical parts of the application. Comprehensive testing ensures code reliability.

- [ ] **Feature: Dependency Management**

  - **Description:** Review and update dependencies to ensure they are up to date and compatible with each other. Keeping dependencies current reduces security risks and improves stability.

- [ ] **Feature: Code Review Guidelines**

  - **Description:** Establish and document code review guidelines to ensure that code quality and architectural patterns are consistently maintained. Code reviews become more effective and structured.

- [ ] **Feature: Automated Code Quality Checks**

  - **Description:** Implement automated code quality checks using tools like ESLint, Prettier, and linters. Automated checks enforce coding standards and catch issues early in the development process.

- [ ] **Feature: Codebase Modularization**

  - **Description:** Break down the codebase into modular components or microservices, promoting separation of concerns and scalability.

- [ ] **Feature: Codebase Analysis Tools**

  - **Description:** Integrate code analysis tools to detect code smells, complexity issues, and security vulnerabilities. These tools help identify areas for improvement.

- [ ] **Feature: Performance Monitoring**

  - **Description:** Implement performance monitoring tools to track application performance in real-time and identify areas for optimization.

- [ ] **Feature: Scalability Planning**

  - **Description:** Develop a plan for application scalability, considering factors like load balancing, caching, and database scaling. Scalability ensures the application can handle growth.
